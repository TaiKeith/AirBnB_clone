# 0x00. AirBnB clone - The console
`Group project` `Python` `OOP`

This is a group project of two, that aims at clone the AirBnB web app.
The project uses Python language as it utilizes it's Object Oriented Programming
structure.

## Background Context
**First step: Write a command interpreter to manage your AirBnB objects.**

This is the first step towards building your first full web application: the AirBnB clone.
This first step is very important because you will use what you build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integrationâ€¦

Each task is linked and will help you to:
* put in place a parent class `BaseModel` to take care of the initialization, serialization & deserialization of your future instances
* create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
* create all classes used for AirBnB (`User`, `State`, `City`, `Place`, ...) that inherit from `BaseModel`
* create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: **File storage**
* creae all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine

### What's a command interpreter?
It's xactly the same as Shell but limited to a specific use-case.
In our case, we want to be able to manage the objects of our project:
* Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
* Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc...
* Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc...)
* Update attributes of an object
* Destroy an object
